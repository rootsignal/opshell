# devops_shell

> Devops Helper

This project is meant to help those that work with a number of AWS accounts.   Always having to login to the console to find the server you want to connect to, if you need to use a bastion host, what key you need to use, etc.

This is still very early in the development phase, and has been developed on a Mac, so your mileage may vary on other platforms.
